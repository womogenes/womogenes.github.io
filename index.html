		Welcome to my site! I have a couple of things.
		
		<ol>
			<li><a href = "./papercranes/index.html">Paper Cranes</a>, my game (which is based off of <a href = "https://decisionproblem.com/paperclips/index2.html">Universal Paperclips</a>).</li>
			
			<li><a href = "./spanishverbs">Spanish Verb Conjugator</a>, a JavaScript tool for conjugating verbs in Spanish.</li>
		</ol>
